Welcome to Cake!

The object of this game is to create portals
to different areas of the game map that will allow
you to avoid obstacles and retrieve a key '~' that
enables you to move onto the next room
Each room entrance is marked by 'D' and each locked
exit door is marked by 'L'.
Your player is moved using the w, a, s, d keys, the
portal energy gun is fired using 'f' and the user can
return to the start screen at any time by pressing 'q'.
%
Different tiles you encounter will have different properties:
'O' - The portal tile, teleports to the location of its
pairing tile on the map
'#' - The only tile able to recieve a portal, they are uncrossable by
either the portal gun or player
'+' - Will not recieve a portal, uncrossable by the player and gun energy 
'X' - Flip flop tile, this tile will flip between the 'X' (which will 
not recieve a portal) and the '#'
"'|' and '_' - Neither will allow the player to cross but will allow gun
energy to pass over
'$' - Signify the end of the game, if you can reach this, you win!
